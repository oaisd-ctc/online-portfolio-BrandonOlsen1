 <!-- About Me -->
    <div class="Aboutmediv">
        <p>Hello My name is Brandon Olsen I am 17 years old and joining this course "Software and Game Development" I
            knew very little about
            computers and programming. I bought my first pc a couple years ago and knew nothing about it besides it was
            super cool and I wanted
            to learn more. This whole year of school has been super hard but super enjoyable. I have learned so much and
            figured out how much I
            truly love computers and programming. Besides enjoying programming and computers I also wrestle I have been
            wrestling all my life and
            I am just a couple wins off of 100 varsity wins which is a pretty big accomplishment. Besides that I also
            really enjoy video games.
            I plan to attend Davenport University to continue to study computer science with some game Development. Game
            development was worth all
            the pain and suffering learning C#. Lots of the second years did not like C# but personally I find C# super
            neat as you are given
            something to do and you know what needs to happen but to then wrestle with code to achieve whatever it is
            that you need to do. Nothing
            beats the feeling of struggling for hours or days and then to figure it out.
