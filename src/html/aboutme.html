        <p>Hello My name is Brandon Olsen I am 17 years old and joining this course "Software and Game Development" I
            knew very little about
            computers and programming. I bought my first pc a couple years ago and knew nothing about it besides it was
            interesting and I wanted
            to learn more. This whole year of school has been super hard but super enjoyable. I have learned so much and
            figured out how much I
            truly love computers and programming. Besides programming and computers I also wrestle I have been
            wrestling all my life and
            I am just a couple wins off of 100 varsity wins which is a pretty big accomplishment. Besides that I also
            really enjoy video games.
            I plan to attend Davenport University to continue to study computer science with some game Development. In this class my favorite thing
            we learned was probably C# because you are given
            something to do and you know what needs to happen but to then wrestle with code to achieve whatever it is
            that you need to do. Nothing
            beats the feeling of struggling for hours or days and then to figure it out.
